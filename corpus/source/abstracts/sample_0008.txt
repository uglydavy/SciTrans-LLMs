This paper presents a novel approach to text classification using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that our method achieves state of the art performance on standard benchmarks.

Our experiments show an improvement of 9% over baseline approaches. The proposed algorithm has time complexity O(n log n) and space complexity O(n).

We validate our approach on the MNLI dataset, achieving a BLEU score of 36. Future work will explore applications to X.
