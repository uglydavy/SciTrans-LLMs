This paper presents a novel approach to machine translation using attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that our method achieves state of the art performance on standard benchmarks.

Our experiments show an improvement of 25% over baseline approaches. The proposed algorithm has time complexity O(n log n) and space complexity O(n).

We validate our approach on the CoNLL dataset, achieving a BLEU score of 44. Future work will explore applications to X.
