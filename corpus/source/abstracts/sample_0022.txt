We investigate the problem of text classification in the context of few-shot learning. Our analysis reveals important insights about the relationship between X and X.

The experimental results demonstrate that X. Statistical analysis confirms significance with p < 0.05.

These findings have implications for X. We discuss limitations and propose directions for future research.
