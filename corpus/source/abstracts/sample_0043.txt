This paper presents a novel approach to machine translation using graph neural networks. We demonstrate that our method achieves state of the art performance on standard benchmarks.

Our experiments show an improvement of 21% over baseline approaches. The proposed algorithm has time complexity O(n log n) and space complexity O(n).

We validate our approach on the GLUE dataset, achieving a BLEU score of 45. Future work will explore applications to X.
